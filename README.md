# SitOnChair_RWD_JS_webpage

This is my first RWD webpage created with HTML, SCSS and JS with Mobile First Design in mind.

Graphics design is copyrighted to CodersLab school.

So far the page is responsive with 3 width breakpoints,

the styling is mostly CSS, made with SASS and Gulp,

top menu items and image descriptions are animated with JavaScript.


I will be adding new functionalities and improvements as I learn.
